JustTweak is a feature flagging framework for iOS apps.
It provides a simple facade interface interacting with multiple tweak providers that are queried respecting a given priority.
Tweaks represent flags used to drive decisions in the client code. 

With JustTweak you can achieve the following:

- use a JSON file to provide the default values for feature flagging 
- use a number of remote tweak providers such as Firebase and Optmizely to run A/B tests and feature flagging  
- enable, disable, and customize features locally at runtime
- provide a dedicated UI for customization (this comes particularly handy for feature that are under development to showcase it to stakeholders)


## Installation

### CocoaPods

JustTweak is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "JustTweak"
```

### Swift Package Manager

JustTweak is also available through SPM. Copy the URL for this repo, and add the package in your project settings.

## Implementation

### Integration

- Define a `LocalTweakProvider` JSON file including your features. Refer to `LocalTweaks_example.json` for a starting point.
- Configure the stack

To configure the stack, you have two options: 

- implement the stack manually
- leverage the code generator tool

#### Manual integration

- Configure the JustTweak stack as following:

```swift
static let tweakManager: TweakManager = {
    var tweakProviders: [TweakProvider] = []

    // Mutable TweakProvider (to override tweaks from other TweakProviders)
    let userDefaultsTweakProvider = UserDefaultsTweakProvider(userDefaults: UserDefaults.standard)
    tweakProviders.append(userDefaultsTweakProvider)
    
    // Optimizely (remote TweakProvider)
    let optimizelyTweakProvider = OptimizelyTweakProvider()
    optimizelyTweakProvider.userId = UUID().uuidString
    tweakProviders.append(optimizelyTweakProvider)

    // Firebase Remote Config (remote TweakProvider)
    let firebaseTweakProvider = FirebaseTweakProvider()
    tweakProviders.append(firebaseTweakProvider)

    // Local JSON-based TweakProvider (default TweakProvider)
    let jsonFileURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "LocalTweaks_example", withExtension: "json")!
    let localTweakProvider = LocalTweakProvider(jsonURL: jsonFileURL)
    tweakProviders.append(localTweakProvider)
    
    return TweakManager(tweakProviders: tweakProviders)
}()
```

- Implement the properties and constants for your features, backed by the `LocalTweakProvider`. Refer to `TweakAccessor.swift` for a starting point.

#### Using the code generator tool

- Add the following to your `Podfile`

```sh
script_phase :name => 'TweakAccessorGenerator',
             :script => '$SRCROOT/../execTool/TweakAccessorGenerator \
               -l $SRCROOT/Resources/LocalTweaks_example.json \
               -o $SRCROOT/Sources/Accessors/ \
               -a GeneratedTweakAccessor',
             :execution_position => :before_compile

```

Every time the target is built, the code generator tool will regenerate the code for the stack. It will include all the properties backing the features defined in the `LocalTweakProvider`.

- Add the generated files to you project and start using the stack.

## Usage

### Basic

If you have used the code generator tool, the generated stack includes all the feature flags. Simply allocate the accessor object and use it to access the feature flags.

```swift
let accessor = GeneratedTweakAccessor(with: <#tweak_manager_instance#>)
if accessor.meaningOfLife == 42 {
    ...
}
```

See `GeneratedTweakAccessor.swift` and `GeneratedTweakAccessor+Constants.swift` for an example of generated code.

### Advanced

If you decided to implement the stack code yourself, you'll have to implemented code for accessing the features via the `TweakManager`.

The three main features of JustTweak can be accessed from the `TweakManager` instance to drive code path decisions.

1. Checking if a feature is enabled

```swift
// check for a feature to be enabled
let enabled = tweakManager.isFeatureEnabled("some_feature")
if enabled {
    // enable the feature
} else {
    // default behaviour
}
```

2. Get the value of a flag for a given feature. `TweakManager` will return the value from the tweak provider with the highest priority and automatically fallback to the others if no set value is found. It throws exeception when a nil Tweak is found which can be catched and handled as needed.

Use either `tweakWith(feature:variable:)` or the provided property wrappers.

```swift
// check for a tweak value
let tweak = try? tweakManager.tweakWith(feature: "some_feature", variable: "some_flag")
if let tweak = tweak {
    // tweak was found in some tweak provider, use tweak.value
} else {
    // tweak was not found in any tweak provider
}
```
Or with do-catch
```swift
// check for a tweak value
do {
    let tweak = try tweakManager.tweakWith(feature: "some_feature", variable: "some_flag")
    // tweak was found in some tweak provider, use tweak.value
    return tweak    
} catch let error as TweakError {
    switch error {
    case .notFound: () // "Feature or variable is not found"
    case .notSupported: () // "Variable type is not supported"
    case .decryptionClosureNotProvided: () // "Value is encrypted but there's no decryption closure provided"
    }
} catch let error { // add a default catch to satisfy the compiler
    print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

`@TweakProperty`, `@OptionalTweakProperty` and `@FallbackTweakProperty` property wrappers are available to mark properties representing feature flags. Mind that in order to use these property wrappers, a static instance of `TweakManager` is needed. 

```swift
@TweakProperty(feature: <#feature_key#>,
               variable: <#variable_key#>,
               tweakManager: <#TweakManager#>)
var labelText: String
```

```swift
@OptionalTweakProperty(fallbackValue: <#nillable_fallback_value#>,
                       feature: <#feature_key#>,
                       variable: <#variable_key#>,
                       tweakManager: <#TweakManager#>)
var meaningOfLife: Int?
```

```swift
@FallbackTweakProperty(fallbackValue: <#nillable_fallback_value#>,
                       feature: <#feature_key#>,
                       variable: <#variable_key#>,
                       tweakManager: <#TweakManager#>)
var shouldShowFeatureX: Bool
```

### Tweak Providers priority

The order of the objects in the `tweakProviders` array defines the priority of the tweak providers.

The `MutableTweakProvider` with the highest priority, such as `UserDefaultsTweakProvider` in the example above, will be used to reflect the changes made in the UI (`TweakViewController`). The `LocalTweakProvider` should have the lowest priority as it provides the default values from a local tweak provider and it's the one used by the `TweakViewController` to populate the UI.

### Migration notes

In order to migrate from manual to the code generated implementation, it is necessary to update to the new `.json` format. To aid with this process we have added the `GeneratedPropertyName` property to the tweak object. Set this value to align with your current property names in code, so that the generated accessor properties match your existing implementation.

### Caching notes

The `TweakManager` provides the option to cache the tweak values in order to improve performance. Caching is disabled by default but can be enabled via the `useCache` property. When enabled, there are two ways to reset the cache:

- call the `resetCache` method on the  `TweakManager`
- post a `TweakProviderDidChangeNotification` notification


### Update a mutable tweak provider at runtime

JustTweak comes with a ViewController that allows the user to edit the `MutableTweakProvider` with the highest priority.

```swift
func presentTweakViewController() {
    let tweakViewController = TweakViewController(style: .grouped, tweakManager: <#TweakManager#>)

    // either present it modally
    let tweaksNavigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController:tweakViewController)
    tweaksNavigationController.navigationBar.prefersLargeTitles = true
    present(tweaksNavigationController, animated: true, completion: nil)

    // or push it on an existing UINavigationController
    navigationController?.pushViewController(tweakViewController, animated: true)
}
```

When a value is modified in any `MutableTweakProvider`, a notification is fired to give the clients the opportunity to react and reflect changes in the UI.

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    NotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self,
                                                   selector: #selector(updateUI),
                                                   name: TweakProviderDidChangeNotification,
                                                   object: nil)
}

@objc func updateUI() {
    // update the UI accordingly
}
```


### Customization

JustTweak comes with three tweak providers out-of-the-box:

- `UserDefaultsTweakProvider` which is mutable and uses `UserDefaults` as a key/value store 
- `LocalTweakProvider` which is read-only and uses a JSON file that is meant to hold the default feature flagging setup
- `EphemeralTweakProvider` which is simply an instance of `NSMutableDictionary`

In addition, JustTweak defines `TweakProvider` and `MutableTweakProvider` protocols you can implement to create your own tweak provider to fit your needs. In the example project you can find some examples which you can use as a starting point.


### Encryption or pre-processing (Advanced)

JustTweak offers the ability to add a `decryptionClosure` to a `TweakProvider`. This closure takes the `Tweak` as input and returns a `TweakValue` as output. The closure allows you to do some preprocessing on your tweak which can e.g. be used to decrypt values. This can be used if you have an encrypted value in your tweaks JSON file as can be seen below:

```json
"encrypted_answer_to_the_universe": {
  "Title": "Encrypted definitive answer",
  "Description": "Encrypted answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything",
  "Group": "General",
  "Value": "24 ton yletinifeD",
  "GeneratedPropertyName": "definitiveAnswerEncrypted",
  "Encrypted": true
}
```

Note that you have to specify if the value is encrypted in your JSON file (with the `Encrypted` property) for the decryption closure to process the value. The decryption closure for the JSON above can be specified as follows:

```swift
tweakProvider.decryptionClosure = { tweak in
    // decrypt `tweak.value` with your cypher of choice and return the decrypted value
}
```

In this way, the tweak fetched from the tweak provider will have the decrypted value.
